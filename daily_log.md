## Done
- Set up FastAPI project with NLP engine (spaCy + scikit-learn)
- Created conversation manager for bilingual responses (EN/ZH)
- Built chat API endpoint at /chat (POST)

## Bugs Encountered
**üêõ CORS Middleware Error** - SOLVED ‚úÖ
- **What**: `TypeError: CORSMiddleware.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'all_methods'`
- **How**: When running `python main.py`, server starts but crashes on first HTTP request
- **Where**: `app/main.py` CORS configuration
- **Fix**: Changed `all_methods=["*"]` to `allow_methods=["*"]`
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect parameter name in FastAPI CORS setup

## Next / Blocked
- Test API endpoints at http://localhost:8000/docs
- Build frontend chat interface (HTML file ready)

## Notes

# May 23, 2025 - Log 02

## Done
- Identified and diagnosed NLP accuracy issues through testing
- Frontend chat interface working properly after fixing DOM manipulation bug
- Bilingual conversation flow functioning (EN/ZH detection working)

## Bugs Encountered
**üêõ Frontend DOM Hierarchy Error** - SOLVED ‚úÖ
- **What**: `HierarchyRequestError: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node'`
- **How**: When clicking Send button, messages wouldn't appear and console showed DOM error
- **Where**: `frontend/index.html` JavaScript `addMessage()` function
- **Fix**: Changed `messageDiv.appendChild(messageDiv)` to `messagesDiv.appendChild(messageDiv)`
- **Root Cause**: Accidentally trying to append element to itself instead of parent container

**üêõ Poor Context Understanding** - IN PROGRESS üü°
- **What**: Intent classification giving wrong results with low confidence
- **How**: 
 - "I want to buy a product" ‚Üí Classified as `cancel_order` (wrong!)
 - "I want to buy, not cancel" ‚Üí Still classified as `cancel_order` (wrong!)
 - Low confidence scores (0.28, 0.31) indicate model uncertainty
- **Where**: `app/models/nlp_engine.py` - basic Naive Bayes classifier
- **Root Cause**: Simple approach using basic TF-IDF + limited training data (5 examples per intent)
- **Tried**: Initial testing revealed the scope of the problem
- **Next**: Apply quick fixes - expand training data, add keyword rules, improve responses

## Next
- **Phase 1 Quick Fixes:**
 1. Expand training data in `app/data/training_data.py` (add 3-5 more examples per intent)
 2. Add keyword-based rules to `classify_intent()` method for better accuracy
 3. Update response templates in `load_responses()` for more natural conversations
- **Phase 2 Robust Solution:**
 - Research transformer models (BERT/DistilBERT) for better understanding
 - Implement conversation memory and context tracking
 - Add dialogue state management

## Learning Notes
- Simple ML models need much more training data than expected
- Hybrid approach (ML + rule-based) often works better for chatbots
- DOM debugging skills proving valuable - caught the appendChild bug quickly
- Bilingual detection working well - Chinese characters properly identified

## Blocked
None - ready to implement quick fixes

## Bugs Encountered
**üîß Poor Context Understanding** (from May 23) - SOLVED ‚úÖ
- **Solution**: Added keyword-based rules alongside ML classification
- **Fix**: Hybrid approach checking for "buy/purchase" vs "cancel/refund" keywords before ML fallback
- **Result**: Intent classification accuracy improved significantly for common cases
- **Files Changed**: `app/models/nlp_engine.py`, `app/data/training_data.py`

**üêõ NumPy Serialization Error** - SOLVED ‚úÖ
- **What**: `PydanticSerializationError: Unable to serialize unknown type: <class 'numpy.bool'>`
- **How**: FastAPI couldn't serialize NumPy types returned by scikit-learn to JSON
- **Where**: `/chat` endpoint when returning confidence scores and intent classifications
- **Fix**: Added explicit type conversion `str(intent), float(confidence)` in classify_intent method
- **Root Cause**: scikit-learn returns numpy.str_ and numpy.float64 instead of Python primitives

**üêõ Frontend Configuration Loading Race Condition** - SOLVED ‚úÖ
- **What**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'DEBUG')` in browser console
- **How**: JavaScript tried to use config before config.js finished loading
- **Where**: `frontend/index.html` initialization code
- **Fix**: Implemented async `waitForConfig()` function with Promise-based loading
- **Result**: Frontend now properly waits for configuration before initializing

**üêõ CORS Policy Blocking Production Frontend** - SOLVED ‚úÖ
- **What**: `Access to fetch blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`
- **How**: Railway backend wasn't configured to allow requests from Netlify domain
- **Where**: Production environment CORS configuration
- **Fix**: Added `https://regal-custard-47715d.netlify.app` to CORS_ORIGINS in .env.production
- **Result**: Frontend successfully communicates with backend API in production

**üêõ Double Slash in API URLs** - SOLVED ‚úÖ
- **What**: Generated URLs had double slashes: `api.railway.app//chat`
- **How**: BACKEND_API_URL in .env had trailing slash, frontend added another
- **Where**: Generated frontend/config.js file
- **Fix**: Removed trailing slash from BACKEND_API_URL environment variable
- **Prevention**: Added URL validation to build script

## Next

## Bugs Encountered
**üêõ SQLAlchemy Column Type Error** - SOLVED ‚úÖ
- **What**: `ArgumentError: 'SchemaItem' object expected, got <class 'datetime.datetime'>`
- **How**: Using Python's `datetime` class instead of SQLAlchemy's `DateTime` type in column definitions
- **Where**: `app/models/database.py` User model column definitions
- **Fix**: Changed `Column(datetime, ...)` to `Column(DateTime, ...)` for all timestamp columns
- **Root Cause**: Import naming conflict between `datetime` module and SQLAlchemy `DateTime` type

**üêõ Database Default Value Timing** - SOLVED ‚úÖ
- **What**: `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` called at class definition time, not row creation
- **How**: All rows getting same timestamp because default was evaluated once at startup
- **Where**: SQLAlchemy model default values for timestamp columns
- **Fix**: Used lambda functions `default=lambda: datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for dynamic evaluation
- **Result**: Each new record gets proper current timestamp

**üêõ SQLAlchemy func.count Import Missing** - SOLVED ‚úÖ
- **What**: `func.count() is not callable` error in conversation statistics
- **How**: Used `func.count()` without importing `func` from SQLAlchemy
- **Where**: `get_user_stats` method in ConversationManager
- **Fix**: Added `from sqlalchemy import func` import, though switched to simpler `.count()` method
- **Learning**: Always check imports when using SQLAlchemy utility functions

**üêõ Uvicorn Reload Warning** - SOLVED ‚úÖ
- **What**: "You must pass the application as an import string to enable 'reload' or 'workers'"
- **How**: Passing app object directly to uvicorn.run() prevents proper hot reloading
- **Where**: Root `main.py` uvicorn configuration
- **Fix**: Changed `uvicorn.run(app, ...)` to `uvicorn.run("app.main:app", ...)`
- **Result**: Proper hot reloading during development, faster iteration cycle

## Next
